# Liam's Bad Bank
## Description 
This repo holds two applications, both called the Bad Bank because they both have no security. I developed "badbank" for submission for my Portfolio Project for Part 2 of MIT XPro's Fullstack development bootcamp. And i developed "badbank_fullstack" for submission for my final project of the MIT bootcamp. The primary difference between the two projects is that during "badbank" I was focusing on front end funcitonality, whereas in "badbank_fullstack" I primarily ignored front end improvements and focused on creating a functioning three tier web app, which I deployed via DigitalOcean. 

In this application you can create an account. And once created log in to the accounts to enter in deposits and withdrawals from your account. You can also see a history of your transactions as well as the details of all the other accounts using the Bad Bank. 

## Skills highlighted 
Building this app was a good excercise in:
* Deploying via DigitalOcean
* Three tier application design
* Database design
* MongoDB
* Dockerizing applications
* Architecture decisions 
* Single Page Applications and routing 
* Utilizing the Create React App
* Utilizing context 
* Deploying a static Single Page Application via AWS

## Potential Future Improvements
Some improvements I would like to make in the future are: 
* Allowing for more complex banking transactions (i.e. transfers between users)
* Improving the UI
